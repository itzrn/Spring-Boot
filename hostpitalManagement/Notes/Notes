What is Spring Boot Data JPA?
    Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) is a standard specification in Java for object-relational mapping
    (ORM) — meaning it defines how Java objects (entities) are mapped to database tables and how you
    interact with a relational database using objects instead of SQL.

    initially it was java Persistence API, then oracle made it open source with the name of
    jakarta persistence api

In production we use either validate or none in -> spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=

JPA is something which have it own set of rules to create any object which can map to table.

spring data jpa provides the boiler plate which minimize the writing of query

Hibernate is something which maps the data to the object
object is coming from JPA and data row is coming form JDBC

In JPA we can write some custom query which called as JPQL
Hibernate also handle how the custom query is need to be converted to query which is understandable by JDBC.


Entity Manager is a thing which work internally the works related to hibernate
In Hibernate Entity lifecycle if the entity is in persistent state then the entity can only be deleted when delete() is called
or the entity is detached

Persistent Context is the first level of caching

PatientRepository is an interface which get implements automatically by the JPA framework

@Transactional -> is used so that there wont be any duplicate call of the query which is already called once

JUNIT is something which helps to test the service without making any apis
Test method should always be of void return type
