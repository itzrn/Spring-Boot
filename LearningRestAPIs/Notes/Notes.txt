Spring Boot follows Three layer architecture corresponding to MVC

Packages(layers)
    Controller ->
    Service -> Used for business logics
    Entity(called as Data Access layer or persistence layer) ->
    Repository ->

The request will go to controller which will create model, to create model it will use service which internally uses entity and repository
and at the end the generated model will send back to controller. Then controller make it as view or json in response


The Three layer architecture ->
1st layer -> Presentation layer -> usually called as controller
2nd layer -> Service layer -> Use to write the business logics
3rd layer -> Persistence layer(or Data Access Layer)

The data transfer happen between Presentation layer and Service Layer using DTO(Data Transfer Object)
The data transfer happens between Service Layer and persistence layer using Entity
Persistence layer interact with Database.

In the same manner the response from Persistence layer to Service layer is send in the form of entity and response from
service layer to presentation layer in the form of DTO. THe response to controller is converted into json and send to client.

In response from controller json is been returned
The object(DTO) is converted into json by HTTPMessageConverter

POJO(or DTO) -> Plain Old Java Object
