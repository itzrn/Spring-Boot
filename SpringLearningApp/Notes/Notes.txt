We can also change the version of java used, using pom.xml file

maven uses pom.xml to manage everything about this project
maven used for different things like dependency management, plugins management or whole java project management through pom.xml

Here we choose java 21 in the spring initializer, in intellij you can only choose the java version 21 or above.

in starting if we run the project(before writing the "/" api) then it will show one error page on browser(localhost:8080)
and if you haven't made any mapping for "/error" then it shows the default page which is getting seen on browser.
This error on browser doesn't mean that your project have error, instead it mean there is no api created yet to show anything on browser
These all things are jsy bcz the dependency we added "spring web" using spring boot initializer


application.properties is uses to configure our spring boot project, with respect to web database


What is Beans?
Beans are the java object which is managed by spring container.
@Component -> is used to create the bean

Spring framework scan the whole project and where ever it get the @Component it makes the bean of that java class and store it.
This scanning is called as component scanning.
After getting java class as bean there is no need of making the object of any class explicitly.


After using @Component on any class
To use that bean we can do either of it
- using Dependency Injection(called as constructor dependency injection) -> using Constructor of tha class which is dependent on that bean
    Here benefit is to have these in your code direct visible and making it final
    so this way is more better
- Field Injection -> using @Autowired
    here benefit is to have private
Doing above things we can do loose coupling


Using application.properties we can make conditionally bean
just one line change the payment service gets change

There are many type of Conditional annotation based on which u can make the beans

IOC Container/Application context/Spring Container
    To look on multiple class and there configurations and make there storage of beans at a place, so that they can be injected whenever they are required

IOC Container checks which all classes?
    Wherever @Component is used


As soon we add autoconfiguration the spring starts to work as spring boot
